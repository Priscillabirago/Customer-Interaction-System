# Customer-Interaction-System
##This is an automated reponse system that is supposed to assist customers at local drug stores based on the information they input and what they need
####Initially, the project was made to request the customer to name the new drug they wanted to purchase even if they didn't make a mistake. Again there were no functions so some steps were quite repetitive. 
####Some features I will implement in this project very soon include: Let the system less robust so the customer can purchase more than one product at a time and not make the price fixed


#####Technogies: Python 3.10
