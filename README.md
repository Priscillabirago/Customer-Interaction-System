# Customer-Interaction-System
### This is an automated reponse system that is supposed to assist customers at local drug stores based on the information they input and what they need
#### Initially, the project was made to request the customer to name the new drug they wanted to purchase even if they didn't make a mistake. Again there were no functions so some steps were quite repetitive. 
#### Some features I will implement in this project very soon include: Let the system less robust so the customer can purchase more than one product at a time and not make the price of all the drugs fixed
#### This project when used in a few local drug stores helped the waiting time of customers that were buying only one product as they didn't have to wait long queues 

#### This project can be modified to be used in different businesses such as a grocery store as long as it has to do with customer interaction
